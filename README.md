## Using MLflow for Experiment Tracking and Model Management
## Objective
The objective of this task is to introduce you to MLflow for experiment tracking, model management, and reproducibility in machine learning projects for the Sentiment
Analysis Prediction [Project](https://github.com/amiegirl/sentiment_analyzer_app).

MLFlow keeps tracks of Tags, Parameters, Metrics, Models, Artifacts, Source code, Start and End time, Authors etc.

Model Registry provides functionality for managing and versioning machine learning models and their associated metadata.
It allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to track, share, and collaborate on models throughout their lifecycle, from experimentation to production deployment.
